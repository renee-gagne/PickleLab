## INSTALLING WITH PIP
### The required installations are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can individually install each file using 'pip install package', or install the requirements.txt file.

## LAUNCHING JUPYTER LAB
### To launch Jupyter Lab, you will need to first install it into your virtual enviornment (pip intall jupyterlab)(see above and requirements.txt). After installing, you can open Jupyter Lab in your browser by typing 'jupyter_lab' into your terminal in your virtual enviornment.

## FITTING A MODEL
### Fitting the model is done after building the pipeline in the test_pickle.py file.

## USING THE TEST FILE
### The test dataset is created by using the json package on a pandas data frame of the first row of data from the dataset.
